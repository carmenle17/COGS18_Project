# COGS18_Project
This is the final project that I made for the WI22 COGS 18 class.

This project takes in user inputs in order to help someone choose a movie from IMDB's list of the top 250 movies. There is an option if you know what year you want to search by, but if you are indecisive or uncertain, there is also an option for the program to generate completely random movie title!
